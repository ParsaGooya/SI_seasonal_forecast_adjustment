# Bias Adjustment of Seasonal Arctic Sea Ice Predictions from the Canadian Earth System Model Version 5

This repository contains scripts for designing, running, and tuning hyperparameters of **post-processing scripts** for deep learning-based bias adjustment of Arctic Sea Ice Concentrations from the CanESM5 model.  

The **deterministic bias adjustment** can be performed using:
- **MLP**  
- **Simple CNN**  
- **Partial Convolution UNet** (based on ConvNeXt)  
- **ConvLSTM**  

The **probabilistic bias adjustment** is based on the **4-way conditional generative model** from Sohn et al. (2015), implemented with **partial convolution ConvNeXt blocks**.

**Note:** This repository is intended for internal script sharing and does not include final, cleaned versions of the codes and scripts.
